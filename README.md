# Clouds inside the Glass

This project is a demo created based on George Hastings' Unicorn tutorial. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to George for generously providing me with the valuable opportunity to participate in the beta testing. 

## Overview

Unicorn is truly a masterpiece. After using it, I immediately fell in love with its capabilities. Without requiring deep knowledge of webGL code, Unicorn enables you to create stunning 3D effects in a short amount of time. It also inspires you to explore and fall in love with webGL beyond Unicorn.

## Features

- **Ease of Use**: No need for complex webGL coding.
- **Efficient Workflow**: Create amazing 3D animations quickly and efficiently.
- **Inspiration Boost**: Encourages further exploration and creativity in webGL.

## Gratitude

A special thanks to George Hastings for his generosity and support. The beta testing experience has been incredibly educational, and I look forward to providing detailed feedback to help improve Unicorn even further.

## Feedback

I will actively learn and use Unicorn, aiming to create breathtaking webGL effects. My feedback from this beta testing period will be provided to help refine and enhance the tool. 

**Thank you once again, George, for this incredible opportunity.**

Happy Coding!
